# Introduction
We present aircraft measuments of BBOA over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using PCASP (Bloggs et al., 2004).

Jones et al 1998 conducted several studies in this region, but continental scale measurements have not previously been made.

There is a large degree of variation in research

# Simulations
We simulate the evolution of particle sizes as they are transported away from the source region.
